## 🔍 Project Summary  
This project is a blockchain-powered application enabling institutions to issue **soulbound, non-transferable certificates** using the ERC-1155 standard. Metadata is hosted on IPFS, and end users (students) can securely access and verify their credentials via a wallet.

## ✅ Core Capabilities  
- Issuance of non-transferable digital certificates (SBTs) bound to wallet IDs  
- Metadata stored on IPFS for transparency and tamper-resistance  
- Front end built with React + Vite for fast, responsive experience  
- Backend powered by Node.js & Express to handle uploads, institution workflows and dashboards  
- Smart contracts (Solidity) using ERC-1155 standard, connected via Ethers.js  
- Real-time certificate verification interface for institutions, students and third parties  

## 🛠 Technology Stack  
- **Blockchain/Web3**: Ethereum, Ethers.js, ERC-1155  
- **Decentralised Storage**: IPFS  
- **Frontend**: React + Vite  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express  
- **Dev Tools**: Hardhat (contract dev & testing), dotenv config, CI setup  

## 🎯 Why It Matters  
Traditional certificate systems are vulnerable to fraud, require manual verification and are inefficient. This DApp offers:  
- A tamper-proof digital credential that cannot be transferred  
- On-chain verification accessible publicly  
- A streamlined issuance process for institutions  
- Improved trust, security and automation  

## 👥 Typical Use-Cases  
- Universities issuing digital diplomas/transcripts  
- Licensing boards issuing professional certifications  
- Employers verifying candidate credentials without third-party services
